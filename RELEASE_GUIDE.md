4. **Add token to GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/WhenMoon-afk/snapshot-mcp-server/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `NPM_TOKEN`

   ```

5. Click "Publish release"

### Step 4: Wait for Automation

GitHub Actions will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Build Windows, macOS, and Linux executables (~5-10 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Attach them to the release
- ‚úÖ Publish package to npm

Monitor progress at: https://github.com/WhenMoon-afk/snapshot-mcp-server/actions

### Step 5: Verify Release

**Check GitHub Release:**
- Executables attached: https://github.com/WhenMoon-afk/snapshot-mcp-server/releases/tag/v1.0.0

**Check npm:**
- Package page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@whenmoon-afk/snapshot-mcp-server
- Try installing: `npx @whenmoon-afk/snapshot-mcp-server`

**Test downloads:**
```bash
# Test the executables work
curl -L -O https://github.com/WhenMoon-afk/snapshot-mcp-server/releases/latest/download/snapshot-mcp-installer-windows.exe
```

## Manual npm Publish (If Automation Fails)

If the GitHub Action fails, you can publish manually:

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in
npm whoami

# Publish
npm publish --access public
```

## Troubleshooting

### "You must verify your email to publish packages"
- Check your email and click the verification link from npm
- Try publishing again

### "You do not have permission to publish"
- Make sure you own the `@whenmoon-afk` scope on npm
- Or change the package name in package.json to something you own

### "npm ERR! 402 Payment Required"
- Scoped packages (`@username/package`) require a paid plan UNLESS published with `--access public`
- Our workflow uses `--access public` flag

### GitHub Actions failing
- Check secrets are set correctly
- Review action logs: https://github.com/WhenMoon-afk/snapshot-mcp-server/actions
- Make sure NPM_TOKEN is valid
